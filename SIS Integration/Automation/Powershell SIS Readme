This script makes use of the invoke-RestMethod which is only present in PowerShell v3. If you do not have PowerShell v3, you can get it from http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=34595.

Also it uses a added powershell cmdlet called "Powershell Community Extensions" PSCX 3.0.0.0. You will need to download the msi file from http://pscx.codeplex.com/downloads/get/523236 Then run the msi installer. You may need to reboot the machine in order for the environment variable paths to take.
